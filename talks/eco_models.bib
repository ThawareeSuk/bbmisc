We present a survey of metapopulation terminology and outline the kinds of studies that have been conducted on single-species and multispecies metapopulations. Metapopulation studies have important conceptual links with the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and with studies on the dynamics of species living in patchy environments. Metapopulation ideas play an increasingly important role in landscape ecology and conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Using both analytic and numerical methods, we elucidate the dynamical properties of a class of metapopulation models in which many different species/strains contend for persistence, with local extinction of subpopulations being balanced by colonization of other patches. The species/strains have a strict competitive hierarchy with a given species/strain "taking over" any patch occupied by a lower-ranking species/strain; competitively inferior species/strains compensate by having higher colonization rates and/or lower patch death rates. New species/strains keep appearing, so that we can follow the evolution of the system. Such models may be metaphors for multispecies metapopulations, or for the evolution of virulence (where the patches are hosts, who are infected with various strains of a pathogen, and then die or recover at strain-dependent rates).

Our emphasis is on a set of questions relating to the evolution of diversity. How many species/strains are present after a long time, t? Asymptotically, this number continues to increase very slowly, as ln t. What are the relative abundances of the species/strains? Under a broad range of assumptions about the mutations which produce new species/strains, the rank-abundance distribution is roughly geometric (as is commonly observed in early succession and other "ecologically one-dimensional" situations); some of our analysis here is based in part on an interesting but unproved mathematical conjecture about a new kind of probabilistic/combinatorial problem. If the number of patches/hosts is permanently reduced--by habitat destruction or vaccination what happens? Characteristically, there is an initial sharp loss of species/strains (with selective removal of the competitive dominants), with subsequent slow recovery as new mutants continue to partition the now-diminished "niche space" (but the pristine levels of virulence are not regained).},

	abstract = {The controversy over whether vaccine-targeted HPV types will be replaced by other oncogenic, non-vaccine-targeted types remains unresolved. This is in part because little is known about the ecology of HPV types. Patient data has been interpreted to suggest independence or facilitative interactions between types and therefore replacement is believed to be unlikely. With a novel mathematical model, we investigated which HPV type interactions and their immune responses gave qualitatively similar patterns frequently observed in patients. To assess the possibility of type replacement, vaccination was added to see if non-vaccine-targeted types increased their ‘niche’. Our model predicts that independence and facilitation are not necessary for the coexistence of types inside hosts, especially given the patchy nature of HPV infection. In fact, independence and facilitation inadequately represented co-infected patients. We found that some form of competition is likely in natural co-infections. Hence, non-vaccine-targeted types that are not cross-reactive with the vaccine could spread to more patches and can increase their viral load in vaccinated hosts. The degree to which this happens will depend on replication and patch colonization rates. Our results suggest that independence between types could be a fallacy, and so without conclusively untangling HPV within-host ecology, type replacement remains theoretically viable. More ecological thinking is needed in future studies.},

	abstract = {Host immune systems impose natural selection on pathogen populations, which respond by evolving different antigenic signatures. Like many evolutionary processes, pathogen evolution reflects an interaction between different levels of selection; pathogens can win in between-strain competition by taking over individual hosts (within-host level) or by infecting more hosts (population level). Vaccination, which intensifies and modifies selection by protecting hosts against one or more pathogen strains, can drive the emergence of new dominant pathogen strains—a phenomenon called vaccine-induced pathogen strain replacement. Here, we review reports of increased incidence of subdominant variants after vaccination campaigns and extend the current model for pathogen strain replacement, which assumes that pathogen strain replacement occurs only through the differential effectiveness of vaccines against different pathogen strains. Based on a recent theoretical study, we suggest a broader range of possible mechanisms, some of which allow pathogen strain replacement even when vaccines are perfect—that is, they protect all vaccinated individuals completely against all pathogen strains. We draw an analogy with ecological and evolutionary explanations for competitive dominance and coexistence that allow for tradeoffs between different competitive and life-history traits.},

This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches." "Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spacial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. The illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases throughout vaccination, quarantine, or calling."--Jacket.},
