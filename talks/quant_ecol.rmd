## general advice

- "are my stats answering my scientific question?"
- "is there something simpler I can do that will still answer the question adequately"? [@murtaugh_simplicity_2007]
- use what the people around you use
- ... but not if they're wrong (if you can help it)
- experimental design $\gg$ statistics
- systematic error $\gg$ random error
- understand *as much as you can* about your methods

# computation

## learn about reproducibility

- learn some [data carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
([workshop @ UF last year](http://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/2015-06-01-reproducible-science-idigbio/))
- transparency for scientific, career-enhancement, ethical, political (FOIA/ClimateGate) ... reasons
- "future you" is your most important collaborator

- [R. Fitzjohn: reproducible research in the R ecosystem](https://github.com/richfitz/reproducibility-2014)


## ask good questions <br>("how not to get flamed on the R list") {.columns-2}

- do your homework
- create a *minimal reproducible example*
- give enough context  
(avoid "X-Y problems")
- be careful about "bugs" and "crashes" (call them "infelicities" instead)

## give back to the community

- cite software
- report bugs (as much detail as possible)
- make suggestions
- help others

## trusting R packages

- how long has the package been around?
- is there an associated peer-reviewed paper?
- who wrote it?
- how widely used is it?
- does it have a vignette?
- is the documentation any good?
- does it have tests?

## toolboxes {.columns-2}

- JAGS/BUGS, AD Model Builder, Template Model Builder, Stan ...
- power tools!
- freedom from many constraints
- fit almost any model, whether it's sensible or not ... [@lavine_living_2010]

> I never blamed the Hole Hawg; I blamed myself. The Hole Hawg is
dangerous because it does exactly what you tell it to. It is not bound
by the physical limitations that are inherent in a cheap drill, and
neither is it limited by safety interlocks that might be built into a
homeowner's product by a liability-conscious manufacturer. The danger
lies not in the machine itself but in the user's failure to envision
the full consequences of the instructions he gives to it ...

# statistics

## learn about p-hacking {.columns-2}

- **exploration**
- **confirmation**  
(hypothesis testing, most model selection)
- **prediction** ...

<!-- -->


be honest!

- pre-register your analyses, at least informally
- don't select and then confirm!
(the gospel of the "minimal adequate model")

## read (some of) these

![](pix/harrell_sm.jpg) ![](pix/gh_sm.jpg) ![](pix/zuur_sm.jpg)

## prioritize

- pick **at most** two of the following:
    - big data
	- structure   
(phylogenetic, spatial, temporal, general blocking)
    - non-Normal distributions  
(binomial, Poisson < zero-inflated, ordinal < censored ...)
	- observation/occupancy modeling
	- multi-causality (structural equation models)
- try to ignore the rest (null hypothesis tests)

## learn some likelihood

![](pix/hilborn_mangel_sm.jpg) ![](pix/bolker_sm.jpg) ![](pix/royall_sm.jpg)

## learn some linear algebra

- focus on concepts and geometry
- analogies with scalar analogues, e.g.   
$(\mathbf x- \boldsymbol\mu) \mathbf V^{-1} (\mathbf x- \boldsymbol\mu)^\top \approx (x-\mu)^2/\sigma^2$

- biological meanings of mathematical objects
- e.g. eigenvectors ...
    - stable age distribution
	- combination of environmental properties
	- combination of morphometric measurements
- mostly ignore computational details
- *sparse* matrices

## learn about linear models

- $\mathbf y \sim \textrm{Normal}(\mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta)$
- *model matrix* $\mathbf X$ captures contrasts among categories,
interactions among variables, more
- underpins most practical statistical models
- many extensions (generalized, mixed, additive ...)
- component of more complex (nonlinear/hierarchical/survival) models
