- good description (graphical/categorical of model types (not just a list); steal from other bakeoff materials?
- bakeoff results!
- description of Adler sims???
- discussion of mechanistic models: https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=mechanistic+species+distribution+models&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&oq=mechanistic+species+
      - "mechanistic"= physiological @kearney_correlative_2010 or dispersal-based @merow_developing_2011?
- discuss?
    - ter Braak (quadratic models)
	- semimechanistic (still doesn't happen very much?)
	- Dennis, Taper, Ponciano demography stuff
- extensions: dynamic movement (cites).
- guilds
- fundamental vs realized niche
- Peters, Breiman clip
- methodological attribution fallacy
- "hypotheses" from paper:
     - flexibility good for common species, doesn't help/hurts with rare species
     - JSDMs improve community-level prediction, not indiv-level prediction (but why not? sharing strength)
	 - spatial/hierarchical structure improves prediction

- remind def of Tjur
- do I have to worry about Tjur vs deviance?

## formatting etc.

- data pix
- make MathJaX self-contained
- break up new bakeoff paper picture into separate cartoons

## Questions for FGB

- why subsample predictors? doesn't this handicap algorithmic approaches unduly?
- why 300 points subsampled from the big data sets? (computational limitations?) same question about 
- want to talk about tuning decisions etc.
- what is the purpose of using lower PC1 values for training set than validation set in butterfly data?
- PM4 (bias in coverage): doesn't use |f-0.95| penalize undercoverage more? is this intentional?
- how exactly do the spatial version (GAM+, GLM+) work?

## Questions on new draft

## To do for FGB (if code available)

- pick a *subset* of methods and responses to draw graphs for: e.g.

(HMSCx, MISTNET, GLMx, GAMx, BRT) -- e.g. something like the best (according to overall? criteria) method for each broad category of methods (e.g. algorithmic vs model-based, joint vs. SS). I don't yet know what all the variants of the different methods are.

On the response side, probably something like overall + Tjur + Species richness rank. I don't yet know what all the variants of the different methods are.

On the response side, probably something like overall + Tjur + Species richness rank. I don't yet know what all the variants of the different methods are.

On the response side, probably something like overall + Tjur + Species richness rank

+ timings.


## GB ideas ...

- mech tells us how to understand the system
- e.g. L-V: r, K, alpha
- we're going to focus on statistical -- which ones are good at linking?
- want good prediction AND good understanding

- extensions: phylogeny, multi-trophic, dispersal

semi-mechanistic models

## fix

horizontal spacing on breiman/peters

## new GB questions

- why these particular species?
- what are the colours in the USA map?
- what about the bird data set?

## refs

MISTNET

## brush up on ...

- model names
- species info
