- good description (graphical/categorical of model types (not just a list); steal from other bakeoff materials?
- bakeoff results!
- description of Adler sims???
- discussion of mechanistic models: https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=mechanistic+species+distribution+models&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&oq=mechanistic+species+
      - "mechanistic"= physiological @kearney_correlative_2010 or dispersal-based @merow_developing_2011?
- discuss?
    - ter Braak (quadratic models)
	- semimechanistic (still doesn't happen very much?)
	- Dennis, Taper, Ponciano demography stuff
- extensions: dynamic movement (cites).
- guilds
- fundamental vs realized niche

## formatting

- data pix
- make MathJaX self-contained

## Questions for FGB

- why subsample predictors? doesn't this handicap algorithmic approaches unduly?
- why 300 points subsampled from the big data sets? (computational limitations?)
- want to talk about tuning decisions etc.
- what is the purpose of using lower PC1 values for training set than validation set in butterfly data?
- PM4 (bias in coverage): doesn't use |f-0.95| penalize undercoverage more? is this intentional?
- how exactly do the spatial version (GAM+, GLM+) work?
